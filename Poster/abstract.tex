Metropolis-Hastings Implementations of the Forward-Filtering-Backward-Sampling Algorithm for Particle Smoothing

The conventional forward-filtering-backward-sampling algorithm for particle smoothing generates samples from the joint smoothing distribution by sequentially sampling backwards from the forward filter approximations. This algorithm has a computational complexity quadratic in the number of particles, which is often restrictive. In addition, the support of the smoothing distribution is restricted to the values which appear in the filtering approximation. Here a Metropolis-Hastings sampling procedure is used to improve the efficiency of the forward-filtering-backward-sampling algorithm, achieving comparable error performance but with a lower execution time. In addition, an algorithm for approximating the joint smoothing distribution without limited support is presented, which achieves simultaneous improvements in both execution time and error. These algorithms also provide a greater degree of flexibility over existing methods, allowing a trade-off between execution time and estimation error, controlled by the length of the Markov chains.
