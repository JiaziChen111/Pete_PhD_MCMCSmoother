  abstract = {A new algorithm for the prediction, filtering, and smoothing of non-Gaussian
	nonlinear state space models is shown. The algorithm is based on
	a Monte Carlo method in which successive prediction, filtering (and
	subsequently smoothing), conditional probability density functions
	are approximated by many of their realizations. The particular contribution
	of this algorithm is that it can be applied to a broad class of nonlinear
	non-Gaussian higher dimensional state space models on the provision
	that the dimensions of the system noise and the observation noise
	are relatively low. Several numerical examples are shown.},
